`Customer Relationship Managment Technology:Office Space`
The company relationship management system can track and manage the ways of every lead and customer that interacts with your company. CRM’s work for several business types across a variety of industries including technology, business services, retail, banking, manufacturing, security, communication and much more. 
We would like to create a CRM that will allow teams to see one centralized area where all information can be located. It saves team members time from searching through emails and trying to hunt down other team members. It will assist with reminders, bookings and tasks at hand.
This CRM will support complex and ever-changing workflows by automating, completing and organizing specific tasks. The system will keep your team in sync by facilitating more effective use of time and eliminating many tedious tasks.
